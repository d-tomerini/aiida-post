# AiiDA interface with an External program

## Communication app between an external program and AiiDA

Implementation of a REST API to implement external communication with AiiDA.
This program will act as a bridge to convey to AiiDA information through HTML communication

## Details

[AiiDA](http://www.aiida.net/) is a flexible and scalable informatics' infrastructure to manage, preserve, 
and disseminate the simulations, data, and workflows of modern-day computational science. 

Our interconnection app will provede very basic interaction with a AIiiDA from a server,
to deal with:
1. Requests for calculated data
2. Requests for stored data
3. Information on stored database nodes (calculations, previous requests)
4. Information on ongoing calculations
