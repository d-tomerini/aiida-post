 Installation

 Prerequisites
===============

The aiida_post extension requires an installation of AiiDA > 1.0.0, and of its REST API extension.
To download it and installed it, preferentially inside a virtual environment, follow the instructtion you can find at this
`page <https://aiida-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/installation.html>`_.

Please set up a virtual environmente with python 3! AiiDA will maintain compatibility with Python 2.7.x only till January 2020, but this extension
depends on asyncronous features available on python 3 only.

The installation from the github repository (useful for developers, if you want to keep up to date with the most recent development)
can be done with the commands below: ::

     $ mkdir <your_directory>
     $ cd <your_directory>
     $ git clone https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core[atomic_tools,docs,advanced_plotting,rest]
     $ pip install

To simply install the most recent stable version of AiiDA from PyPi it suffices to just type in a terminal
``pip install aiida-core[atomic_tools,docs,advanced_plotting,rest]``.

The options in square bracket are a list of useful AiiDA extensions. Only the REST extension is required.

Python package
==============

The python package can be obtained from the `Intersect gitlab repository <https://gitlab.cc-asp.fraunhofer.de/intersect/ext_to_aiida>`_.
The repository can be cloned locally: ::

    $ mkdir <your_directory>
    $ cd <your_directory>
    $ git clone https://gitlab.cc-asp.fraunhofer.de/intersect/ext_to_aiida
    (aiida) $ pip install -e aiida-post

The ``-e`` option instructs to find the package specifically on the provided path.

Updating the entry points
-------------------------

AiiDA (and its extensions) uses the ``reentry`` package to cache the entry points. This provides access to the classes and workflows avaible to AiiDA.
After installing or updating a package is necessary to update the reentry cache by typing ::

    reentry scan

please set up
AiiDA depends on a number of specific third party packages. For this reason
